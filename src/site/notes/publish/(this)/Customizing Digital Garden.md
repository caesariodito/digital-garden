See [Digital Garden docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/note-specific-settings/) for more info.

Here are some interesting information that I found:
1. If I ever wanted to customize specific pages/notes on my website, I can use `dg-content-class` with the specified classname in the frontmatter to render my custom css.
2. I can customize icon with dg-note-icon, and edit directly into the [source code](https://github.com/caesariodito/digital-garden/blob/main/src/site/styles/digital-garden-base.scss), but do it [here](https://github.com/caesariodito/digital-garden/blob/main/src/site/styles/custom-style.scss).
3. Edit metatags for custom description, title, and image when sharing to others.
4. See [other's digital garden repo](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/blob/main/src/site/styles/custom-style.scss) for future references.
