A note taking framework to create a [web of knowledge](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=b178d4c9b009a105&sxsrf=ADLYWII7vh0RtsGdjy0g2QX8whS75cOATQ:1729160821482&q=web+of+knowledge+obsidian&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0CvspUPonaF8UH5s_LBD3JPX4RSeMPt9v8oIaeGMh2T2PRrsfVPlQRxSTpQ4UUI6wfsFlEVaMALnJjEZtYpSTLmUV5oGF4fnHSG0LbvLjVKUV0IWX-9yHknaXpsINbxRPK_rD0aGBXyqo-cUa2T6ZySNg4d875n-vXkSutq7bWvEyjXRQuBfWktFSUkoyoeiqhKHNE-BZiSEnsk93CG_Dl8i5jDTw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpnZiEmpWJAxWf2TgGHfkKLKoQtKgLegQIEhAB&biw=1690&bih=955), to build a 2nd brain, but personally, I use this for fun. The way it works is to breakdown knowledge into atom-like notes and link out each knowledge into firmer notes that contains multiple source of notes as a definition, reference, or any.

The main goal to use this method for me, is to build up my personal knowledge assistant that I will be using personally. That's a bit ambitious ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but I believe the technology will be able to do it.

I see it as a bottom-up approach but I think the process to breakdown the knowledge is top-bottom. Here are some of the important information for the zettelkasten method.

## Common Questions

- [How many Zettelk√§sten should I have?](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-many-zettelkasten/) The answer is, most likely, only one for the duration of your life. But there are exceptions to this rule.
- [Don‚Äôt use categories.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/) Use tags instead.
- ‚ÄúWhat should my first note be?‚Äù ‚Äì [it doesn‚Äôt matter.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/your-first-note/) Just get started.
- [Set links between notes.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/search-alone-is-not-enough) Full-text search on its own provides not enough information. Connections will do, especially in the long run.
- [‚ÄúWhen should I start a new note?‚Äù](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/when-start-new-note/)
    - Also read [‚ÄúTrust the process‚Äù](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/trust-the-process-nickmilo22/), an essay.
- You have to [interpret your sources](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/dont-rely-on-source-have-faith-in-yourself/) and then rely on your own thoughts henceforth to get the maximum benefit. Collecting information does not increase your knowledge.
- [Use outlines](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-i-use-outlines-to-write-any-text/) to start with the first draft of your writing project.
- Then [ease into writing](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/ease-into-writing/) by adding Zettel notes to the outline, pasting their contents in.
